Employee Login Folder

-banner3.png -> not used at this time
-employee-loginTest.html -> displays main employee login page
-employee-survey.html -> creates the employee survey
-login-logout.html -> creates full employee login page
-survey-test.html -> displays the employee survey only
-tutor-log.html -> creates block containing tutor information

Page Purpose:
The Employee Login Page is created to add tutor to page when logging in and remove tutor when logging out. When tutor logs out they are sent to employee-survey.html. They will rank their session 1-5. If 1 or 2 is selected an email will be sent to SPC informing them of the tutor name and that a followup inquiry is needed.
