Service Configuration Folder

banner3.png -> you should know by now
service-list.html -> the module that hosts the service editor. It allows for the addition of new services and editing of existing services. To edit a service, use the same ID as an existing service. To select locations for the service, click on them so they are highlighted.
service-selector.html -> a single entry in the list of available services. To delete a service, hover over a service and click the X. It is recommended that you archive services instead of delete them, for historical data purposes.
serviceTest.php -> a file used to test the service-list module.

Page Purpose:
