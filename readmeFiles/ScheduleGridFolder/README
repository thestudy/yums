Schedule Grid Folder

BEFORE READING ANYTHING ELSE, READ THIS:
This module is very buggy. There are some problems with making deep edits on arrays (edits on arrays within arrays)
sometimes these edits will not propagate an "edited" alert to modules above them, so we had to do some workaraounds.
these workaraounds were implemented by Jesse Melhuish, so it's hard to say if we'll ever understand how they work.
Basically instead of changing just a single element in a nested array, he updates the entire schedule-column. I think.
Anyways, heres the rest of the README:

banner3.png -> banner image (this is in almost everything)
ColorSelectorTest.php -> just a test file for selecting active colors
GridTest.php -> another test file for the schedule-grid
highlight-radio-label.html -> a label with a small swatch indicating the color
schedule-cell.html -> a cell in the schedule-grid. It can be colored
schedule-color-selector.html -> module tested by ColorSelectorTest.php
schedule-column.html -> a group of schedule-cells, into a column
schedule-grid.html -> a group of schedule-columns, into the full grid
schedule-order.html -> the module that controls minute interval, start time, end time, start date, end date... it determines the size of the schedule-grid
schedule-times.html -> a module that controls how much of the schedule must be filled out as 'available' by a tutor
ScheduleGrid.php -> the test file for EVERYTHING
TimeTest.php -> a test file for schedule-times.html

Page Purpose:
The Schedule Grid is created to show when a particular tutor is available/unavailabe for a specific time.
Right now the schedule only shows 1 week. This could be changed.
