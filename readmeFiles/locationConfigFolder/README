Location Configure Folder

-banner3.png -> creates the top blue bar
-location-list.html -> creates entire page consisting of a location editor and a list of locations below.
-location-selector.html -> a single location entry in the list. Consists of a location Name, Location, ID, and archived checkbox.
-locationTest.php -> test file that runs the location-list module

Page Purpose:
The Location Configure Page is created to add new locations (for use in services) with a name, location, and unique ID. If the location is not active anymore it can be ‘archived’ (by clicking the box) or deleted by clicking the ‘X’ when the paper element is hovered over. It is recommended that the location is only archived never deleted for history data. Each location can be updated by using the same ID number when adding a new location.
